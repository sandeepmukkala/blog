                    Most side projects die in a weekend. Mine turned into a mission. Here's the story of how personal frustration led me to build two AI-powered tools — and the lessons I learned along the way.

                        I've always been the kind of person who builds things to scratch my own itch. If something frustrates me enough, I'll eventually open a code editor and try to fix it. That instinct is how these projects were born — not as a grand plan, but as a series of personal projects that grew into something bigger than I expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This post is about that journey: the problems I kept running into, the tools I built to solve them, and the ideas I'm chasing next.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>The Frustration That Started It All</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over seven years in enterprise engineering, I sat through thousands of meetings. Important decisions were made, action items were assigned, insights were shared — and then most of it vanished. Note-takers were too busy writing to participate. Zoom transcription didn't work for in-person meetings. And for multilingual teams, there was simply no tool that could transcribe a meeting in one language and summarize it in another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I looked at what existed — and everything fell short in some way. Most tools required bots to join your calls (uncomfortable for many people). Others were English-only. Some were absurdly expensive. And none of them handled the simple case of "I'm sitting in an in-person meeting with my phone in my pocket."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I did what any frustrated engineer would do: I built my own.
                    </p>

                <div class="glass-section glass-section--transcriptly">
                    <h2>Project #1: Transcriptly</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post__product">
                        <div class="blog-post__mockup blog-post__mockup--glass">
                            <img src="assets/transcriptly-screen.svg" alt="Transcriptly app screenshot" class="product__screen-img">
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-post__product-text">
                            <p>
                                <strong>Transcriptly</strong> is a meeting transcription app I built from scratch — iOS, Android, and Web from a single codebase. The idea is dead simple: open the app, select a language, tap record, and put your phone down. It keeps recording even when your phone locks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the meeting ends, AI transcribes the audio, generates a structured summary with key points and action items, and — here's the part I'm most proud of — if the meeting was in a non-English language, it automatically provides both the original transcription AND an English translation. Dual output, zero extra steps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It supports 14 languages today: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, Hindi, Tamil, Chinese, Arabic, Bengali, Kannada, and Telugu. You can also record offline and transcribe later when you have connectivity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Building this taught me a lot about audio processing on mobile, cross-platform development, and the nuances of multilingual AI. It also taught me that the best product decisions come from being your own user.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                <div class="glass-section glass-section--translatory">
                    <h2>Project #2: Translatory</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post__product blog-post__product--reverse">
                        <div class="blog-post__mockup blog-post__mockup--glass blog-post__mockup--translatory">
                            <img src="assets/translatory-screen.svg" alt="Translatory app screenshot" class="product__screen-img">
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-post__product-text">
                            <p>
                                While building Transcriptly, I stumbled into an adjacent problem that was even more neglected: <strong>document translation</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not the "paste text into a translation box" kind. I'm talking about real documents — contracts with watermarks, forms with handwritten fill-ins, invoices with company logos and borders, government documents with official stamps and signatures. When you translate these through existing tools, you get a wall of plain text. The layout is gone. The signatures are gone. The watermarks are gone. The document is fundamentally broken.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I built <strong>Translatory</strong> — a format-preserving document translation tool. Upload an image, PDF, DOCX, or PPTX, and get back a fully translated document that looks like it was originally written in the target language. Watermarks, borders, logos, signatures — everything stays intact. 50+ languages supported.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project pushed me deep into some of the hardest unsolved problems in document processing. It's the kind of unsexy engineering challenge that nobody talks about at conferences — but millions of people deal with every day.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>What I Learned Building These Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        A few things became clear to me after building both Transcriptly and Translatory:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start with the problem, not the technology.</strong> I didn't set out to "use AI." I set out to fix something that annoyed me. The technology was just the tool I reached for.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multilingual support isn't a feature — it's a responsibility.</strong> 75% of the world doesn't speak English. Building English-only tools means ignoring most of humanity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy matters more than convenience.</strong> People are uncomfortable with bots in their meetings and their documents being sent to unknown servers. Privacy-first architecture isn't just ethical — it's a competitive advantage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Invest heavily in automated testing.</strong> When you're the only developer, a robust test suite is your safety net. It lets you move fast without breaking things.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section glass-section--accent">
                    <h2>What's Next: AI for Agriculture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Language barriers affect productivity. Food insecurity affects survival. The same AI capabilities I've built for language — computer vision, multilingual interfaces, mobile-first apps — are exactly what's needed on the farm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With over 500 million smallholder farms worldwide feeding 80% of the global population, even small improvements in yield and efficiency can transform lives. I'm building AI tools that are accessible, affordable, and designed for the fields — not just the boardroom. This project is currently <strong>in progress</strong>. More details coming soon.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>My Philosophy: Code with a Cause</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Code with a cause" is a personal rule I follow. Every project I take on has to pass a simple test: <strong>does this solve a real problem for real people?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not interested in building the next chatbot wrapper or AI art generator. There are enough of those. I'm interested in the boring, hard, unglamorous problems — the ones that affect billions of people but don't make for viral demos.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>
                        We're at an incredible inflection point. AI costs have collapsed. Open-source models now rival proprietary ones. Cross-platform frameworks have matured to the point where a solo engineer can build for iOS, Android, and Web from a single codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first time, one person with a laptop can build tools that genuinely compete with well-funded teams. The barriers have never been lower. The only question is: <strong>what will you build?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I choose to build tools that matter. Tools that help a consultant in Tokyo document her meeting in Japanese and share it in English. Tools that help a government clerk translate a legal document while preserving every signature and watermark. And this is just the beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's what this blog will be about — the projects I'm building, the ideas I'm exploring, the problems I'm trying to solve, and the lessons I learn along the way.

                        I'm just getting started.
