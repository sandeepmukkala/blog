                    Most side projects die in a weekend. Mine turned into a mission. Here's the story of how personal frustration led me to build AI-powered tools — and the lessons I learned along the way.

                        I've always been the kind of person who builds things to scratch my own itch. If something frustrates me enough, I'll eventually open a code editor and try to fix it. That instinct is how these projects were born — not as a grand plan, but as a series of personal projects that grew into something bigger than I expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This post is about that journey: the problems I kept running into, the tools I built to solve them, and the ideas I'm chasing next.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>The Frustration That Started It All</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over seven years in enterprise engineering, I sat through thousands of meetings. Important decisions were made, action items were assigned, insights were shared — and then most of it vanished. Note-takers were too busy writing to participate. Existing transcription tools didn't work well for in-person meetings. And for multilingual teams, the options were almost non-existent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I looked at what existed — and everything fell short in some way. Most tools had significant limitations that made them impractical for real-world use. The gaps were obvious once you noticed them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I did what any frustrated engineer would do: I started building.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section glass-section--transcriptly">
                    <h2>Project #1: AI-Powered Meeting Transcription</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post__product">
                        <div class="blog-post__mockup blog-post__mockup--glass">
                            <img src="assets/transcriptly-screen.svg" alt="Meeting transcription app concept" class="product__screen-img">
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-post__product-text">
                            <p>
                                The first tool I built tackles a problem every knowledge worker knows: capturing what happens in meetings. I wanted something that just worked — across platforms, across languages, without changing how people already meet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I designed it from the ground up to handle multilingual scenarios that existing tools ignore entirely. The AI doesn't just transcribe — it understands context, generates structured outputs, and bridges language barriers automatically.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Building this taught me a lot about audio processing, cross-platform development, and the nuances of multilingual AI. It also taught me that the best product decisions come from being your own user.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The best tools don't ask you to change your workflow. They fit into the way you already work.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section glass-section--translatory">
                    <h2>Project #2: AI-Powered Document Translation</h2>

                        <div class="blog-post__mockup blog-post__mockup--glass blog-post__mockup--translatory">

                        <div class="blog-post__product-text">
                            <p>
                                While working on the first project, I stumbled into an adjacent problem that was even more neglected: <strong>document translation</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not the "paste text into a box" kind. I'm talking about real documents — the kind with complex layouts, visual elements, and formatting that matters. When you translate these through existing tools, you lose everything that makes the document a document. The output is unusable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So I built a tool that solves this problem in a way that existing solutions simply don't. The engineering challenges were some of the hardest I've faced — the kind of problems that nobody talks about at conferences, but millions of people deal with every day.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>What I Learned Building These Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        A few things became clear to me after building both tools:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start with the problem, not the technology.</strong> I didn't set out to "use AI." I set out to fix something that annoyed me. The technology was just the tool I reached for.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multilingual support isn't a feature — it's a responsibility.</strong> 75% of the world doesn't speak English. Building English-only tools means ignoring most of humanity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy matters.</strong> People care deeply about where their data goes. Respecting that isn't optional — it's foundational.</li>
                        <li><strong>Invest heavily in automated testing.</strong> When you're the only developer, a robust test suite is your safety net. It lets you move fast without breaking things.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section glass-section--accent">
                    <h2>What's Next</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm exploring how the same AI capabilities I've built for language — computer vision, multilingual interfaces, mobile-first design — can be applied to other domains where technology is lagging behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are entire industries where the tools haven't caught up to the needs. I'm working on identifying the right problems and building solutions that are accessible and affordable for the people who need them most. More details coming soon.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>My Philosophy: Code with a Cause</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Code with a cause" is a personal rule I follow. Every project I take on has to pass a simple test: <strong>does this solve a real problem for real people?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not interested in building the next chatbot wrapper or AI art generator. There are enough of those. I'm interested in the boring, hard, unglamorous problems — the ones that affect billions of people but don't make for viral demos.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="glass-section">
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>
                        We're at an incredible inflection point. AI costs have collapsed. Open-source models now rival proprietary ones. Cross-platform frameworks have matured to the point where a solo engineer can build for multiple platforms from a single codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first time, one person with a laptop can build tools that genuinely compete with well-funded teams. The barriers have never been lower. The only question is: <strong>what will you build?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I choose to build tools that matter. Tools that break language barriers and make information accessible to everyone, regardless of what language they speak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's what this blog will be about — the projects I'm building, the ideas I'm exploring, the problems I'm trying to solve, and the lessons I learn along the way.

                        I'm just getting started.
